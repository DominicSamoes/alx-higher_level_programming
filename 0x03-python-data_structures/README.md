# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. Print a list of integers](./0-print_list_integer.py)
* Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
  	- Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
	- Format: one integer per line. 
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You can assume that the list only contains integers
	- You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
	- You have to use str.format() to print integers


### [1. Secure access to an element in a list](./1-element_at.py)
* Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
	* Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
	* If idx is negative, the function should return None
	* If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None
	* You are not allowed to use try/except
