# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. Lookup](./0-lookup.py)
* Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:
  	- Prototype: def lookup(obj):
	- Returns a list object
	- You are not allowed to import any module

### [1. My list](./1-my_list.py)
* Write a class MyList that inherits from list:
	- Public instance method: def print_sorted(self): that prints the list, but sorted (ascending sort)
	- You can assume that all the elements of the list will be of type int
	- You are not allowed to import any module
