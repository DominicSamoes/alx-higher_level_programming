# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Description

Tasks on .

What I learned from the tasks:

* Why indentation is so important in Python
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use the while and for loops
* How to use the break and continues statements
* How to use else clauses on loops
* How to use range
* How to use pass statement

# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing ](./0-positive_or_negative.py)
* Program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed
* Prints whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative
* Output of the program:
  - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
  - if the number is 0: is zero
  - if the number is less than 0: is negative
* Followed by a new line


### [1. The last digit](./1-last_digit.py)
* Program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed
* Print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number
* Output of the program:
	- The string Last digit of, followed by
	- the number, followed by
	- the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
		+ if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
		+ if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
		+ if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
* Followed by a new line 

### [2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](./2-print_alphabet.py)
* Program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
	- Print can only be used with string format
	- Only one loop can be used in code
	- Characters cannot be stored in a variable

	- Numbers or strings cannot be stored in a variable
	- No importation of any module allowed


### [6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need](./6-print_comb3.py)
* Program that prints all possible different comninations of two digits.
	- Numbers separated by ',', followed by a space 
	- The two digits must be different
	- 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
	- Smallest combination of two digits is printed
	- Numbers printed in ascending order, with two digits
	- Last number followed by a new line
	- Maximum of three print functions
	- No more than two loops
	- Numbers or strings cannot be stored in a variable
	- No importation of any module allowed


### [7. islower](./7-islower.py)
* Function  that checks for lowercase character
	- Prototype: def islower(c):
	- Returns True if c is lowercase
	- Returns False otherwise
	- No importation of any module allowed
	- Not allowed to use str.upper() and str.isupper()



### [8. To uppercase](./8-uppercase.py)
* Function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line
	- Prototype: def uppercase(str):
	- Maximum of two print functions
	- One loop allowed 
	- No importation of any module allowed
	- Not allowed to use str.upper() and str.isupper()


### [9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important](./9-print_last_digit.py)
* Function that prints the last digit of a number
	- Prototype: def print_last_digit(number):
	- Returns the value of the last digit
	- No importation of any module allowed
