# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing ](./0-positive_or_negative.py)
* Program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed
* Prints whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative
* Output of the program:
  - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
  - if the number is 0: is zero
  - if the number is less than 0: is negative
* Followed by a new line


### [1. The last digit](./1-last_digit.py)
* Program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed
* Print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number
* Output of the program:
	- The string Last digit of, followed by
	- the number, followed by
	- the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
		+ if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
		+ if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
		+ if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
* Followed by a new line 

### [2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](./2-print_alphabet.py)
* Program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
	- Print can only be used with string format
	- Only one loop can be used in code
	- Characters cannot be stored in a variable
	- No importation of any module allowed

### [3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off](./3-print_alphabt.py)
* Prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
	- Print all the letters except q and e
	- Print can only be used with string format
	- Only one loop can be used in code
	- Characters cannot be stored in a variable
	- No importation of any module allowed

### [4. Hexadecimal printing](./4-print_hexa.py)
* Program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
	- Print can only be used with string format
	- Only one loop can be used in code
	- Numbers cannot be stored in a variable
	- No importation of any module allowed
