## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim and emacs.
* All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS using using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Code style used is pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All files executable
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
