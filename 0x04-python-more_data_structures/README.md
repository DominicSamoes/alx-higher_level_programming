# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. Squared simple](./0-square_matrix_simple.py)
* Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
  - Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
matrix is a 2 dimensional array
	- Returns a new matrix:
		+ Same size as matrix
		+ Each value should be the square of the value of the input
	- Initial matrix should not be modified
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.
