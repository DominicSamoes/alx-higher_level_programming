## 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description

Tasks on .

What I learned from the tasks:

* What are sets and how to use them
* What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
* When to use sets versus lists
* How to iterate into a set
* What are dictionaries and how to use them
* When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
* What is a key in a dictionary
* How to iterate over a dictionary
* What is a lambda function
* What are the map, reduce and filter functions

# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. Squared simple](./0-square_matrix_simple.py)
* Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
  - Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
matrix is a 2 dimensional array
	- Returns a new matrix:
		+ Same size as matrix
		+ Each value should be the square of the value of the input
	- Initial matrix should not be modified
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.

### [1. Search and replace](./1-search_replace.py)
* Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
	- Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):
	- my_list is the initial list
	- search is the element to replace in the list
	- replace is the new element
	- You are not allowed to import any module

### [2. Unique addition](./2-uniq_add.py)
* Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
	- Prototype: def uniq_add(my_list=[]):
	- You are not allowed to import any module

### [3. Present in both](./3-common_elements.py)
* Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
	- Prototype: def common_elements(set_1, set_2):
	- You are not allowed to import any module

### [4. Only differents](./4-only_diff_elements.py)
* Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
	- Prototype: def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2):
	- You are not allowed to import any module
