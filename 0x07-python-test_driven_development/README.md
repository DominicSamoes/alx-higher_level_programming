# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Description

Tasks on .

What I learned from the tasks:

* What’s an interactive test
* Why tests are important
* How to write Docstrings to create tests
* How to write documentation for each module and function
* What are the basic option flags to create tests
* How to find edge cases

---

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim and emacs.
* All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS using using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Code style used is pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All files executable
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. Integers addition](./0-add_integer.py)
* Write a function that adds 2 integers.
  	- Prototype: def add_integer(a, b=98):
	- a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer
	- a and b must be first casted to integers if they are float
	- Returns an integer: the addition of a and b
	- You are not allowed to import any module
