# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. Read file](./0-read_file.py)
* Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:

	- Prototype: def read_file(filename=""):
	- You must use the with statement
	- You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.
	- You are not allowed to import any module

### [1. Write to a file](./1. Write to a file) 
* Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written:

	- Prototype: def write_file(filename="", text=""):
	- You must use the with statement
	- You don’t need to manage file permission exceptions.
	- Your function should create the file if doesn’t exist.
	- Your function should overwrite the content of the file if it already exists.
	- You are not allowed to import any module
